# First test news

###### April 12, 2022 ######

Hey, guys. This is our first test news. It's slanted, it's crooked, but it's on the site. We are working and trying to make a cool project for you. =)

>Next comes the test part of our updates and what they will look like.

Dear inmates, we are announcing the first guaranteed whitelist to receive free NFT.

To receive free NFT you must:
1. Invite 15 people to the discord server https://www.discord.gg/convicted
2. Subscribe to our https://www.twitter.com/convictednft

Whitelist will last up to 5000 participants in the discord server. After that we'll let you know how to get your NFT.

>Q: How do I invite people to the discord server?

>A: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204155938-How-do-I-invite-friends-to-my-server-

>Q: How do I check how many people I invited?

>A: To check how many invited friends we have a specific channel invites, in which there are two commands:

/invites - th number of users you invited.
/leaderboard invites - the table of leaders.

(It is important that the invited user is a person who has not left the server during the whole period of the whitelist - "regular").

Good luck!
